# GHCN daily temperature analysis

Analysis of the GHCN temperature dataset using Numpy. This notebook is part of my data analysis course I am currently preparing for the [Engeto IT academy](https://engeto.cz/). This tutorial contains the following tasks and solutions:

- How to download data from an FTP server using Python
- How to use the GHCN-daily temperature dataset?
- How to find the ID and name of the available temperature stations?
- How to import daily temperature readings into Numpy?
- How to handle missing data?
- How to smooth time-based data (using moving average) in Numpy?
- How to resample daily data into monthly averages?
- How to compare monthly averages using matplotlib?

Data description and more info can be found in the notebook
